Church itself, by a number of §YReformers§! and their adherents, will in time have a profound impact on the political life on Europe. More immediately, however, dynamic statesmen are reshaping the world to their liking.\n\nIn Western Europe, §YFrance§!, §YSpain§! and §YAustria§! are in constant conflict over §YItaly§! and the §YLow Countries§!. Spain is especially eager for European endeavors, bolstered by the sudden fall of the §YAztec§! and §YInca§! Empire, and the massive influx of wealth this brought them.\n\nThe Kalmar Union, once the defining alliance of Northern Europe, has been broken apart by §YSwedish§! noblemen, eager to build an empire of their own, rather than to serve in one ruled from Copenhagen.\n\nIn the Near East, the §YOttomans§! are about to embark on more large scale expansion than ever before in their history. §YPersia§!, recently united by the §YSafavid§! dynasty, is expanding in the opposite direction, headed for a direct confrontation.\n\nIn Kabul, the last §YTimurid§! prince, Babur, is gathering his forces for one final attempt to salvage an Empire for his dynasty. Destined to be successful beyond his wildest dreams, he is about to found an Empire to rule one fourth of the world's population.\n\nFor the most part however, the world of [GetYear] remains one of mostly isolated regions. All this is about to change, and not only due to the Spanish Imperial project in the Americas.\n§YPortugal§! is steadily expanding their influence in the Indian Ocean, Indonesia and even East Asia.

Empire to his son Aurangzeb. In time it will come to encompass almost the entire Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn East Asia, the §YManchu§! Jurchens have united, posing a threat to a §YMing§! Empire destabilized by inner turmoil and natural disasters.\n§YJapan§! looks to have entered a period of peace, as the §YTokugawa§!

Empire has reached its widest extent, but in order to do so Aurangzeb has seriously overextended its resources, while giving influential administrators a greater deal of autonomy than the Imperial system can easily handle.\n\nIn Europe, the era of Absolutism has left the continent dominated by strong, hungry, and militaristic states.\nWithin a century, some of these kingdoms will spend great resources tearing each other apart, with the weaker ones, such as §YSweden§! or §YPoland§!, left by the wayside.\n\nHowever, a much greater threat will in time reveal itself from within.
